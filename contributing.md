## Issues

### Bug Reports

We use GitHub [issues](https://github.com/redhat-beyond/AcadeMe/issues) to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!
Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can.
- What actually happens.
- Make it visual - use photos and screenshots if you can.

People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
